Tea is the national drink of the Chinese people, developed in Shennong, heard in Lu Zhou Gong, flourished in the Tang Dynasty, flourished in the Song Dynasty and became popular in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Chinese tea culture combines the ideas of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism into a single entity, and it is a wonder of Chinese culture! China's tea region is vast, and the division of tea areas takes 3 levels, namely the first level tea area (with the southwest and Jiangnan regions as the table), the second level tea area (with the northwest and north of the river), and the third level tea area (with the south of China as the representative).
