              <p class="zi2">Tea Bacchanal</p>
              Tea Baise was first seen in the Tang Dynasty, when Liu Yuxi described it in his 'Song of Tea Tasting at Lanruo in the Western Mountains': "The sound of the sudden rain and pine coming into the tripod, the white clouds full of flowers wandering in the bowl." In the Song Dynasty, due to the esteem of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty and the court ministers and literati, the tea opera was taken to the extreme. Song Huizong not only wrote "Da Guan tea theory" on the point of tea, tea, but also personally cooked tea to give a banquet to the ministers. Many literati such as Tao Gu, Lu You, Li Qingzhao, Yang Wanli, Su Shi all loved to share tea and left many poems describing the sharing of tea. Lu You described the tea splitting scene in "The Early Spring Rain in Lin'an": "The short paper slanting lines were idly made into grass, and the fine milk in the clear window played with the tea splitting." Tao Gu in "Thea Minh Lu" recorded: "Hundred tea play ...... in recent times, there is under the soup transport dagger, and other subtle techniques, so that the soup pattern water veins into objects, animals, insects, fish, flowers and plants of the genus, delicate as a picture, but a short time that is scattered." Yuan Dynasty after the gradual decline of split tea, after the Qing Dynasty so far no detailed documentation of split tea.
              <p>The Tea Bacchanal originates from ancient records such as Tao Gu's "The Book of Tea" in the Northern Song Dynasty. The use of water to transform patterns on the tea broth is the unique soul of the art. It is manifested in several ways:   </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Firstly, the raw material for the performance of the Tea Bacchanal is the powdered tea, the medium for the painting is the suspension of tea soup, composed of solid tea powder, water and air bubble particles, is the powdered tea is finely ground and water to whisk the formation.
                    The Tea Bacchanal is so far discovered, Chinese history with gas material as the medium for the expression of the pattern of the only method.      </li>
                <li>Secondly, the painting method used to express the Tea Bacchanal plays is unique, using colourless water to paint on the tea broth suspension. The colourless water will turn white when added to the tea broth suspension, and the design will be formed.
                    This is the only way of painting with water in Chinese history that has been discovered to date.      </li>
                <li>Thirdly, the effect of painting is very unique, the pattern is formed by adding transparent water to the suspension of tea broth and turning white, unlike ordinary painting with colour smearing. At the same time, the same tea broth can be painted several times to form different patterns.      </li>
                <li>The coffee and tea paste paintings are all painted with colours, and do not have the unique artistic soul of the tea play.
                    Life is the fireworks in the tea soup. </li>
                <li>    Tea Bacchanal has a unique artistic expression. It is a unique art form of liquid expression of calligraphy and painting, as the tea broth reveals a rich natural movement of texture, and at the same time, the pattern can be changed many times in the same tea broth. With its unique expressiveness, it expresses the beauty of mood, line and haze of Chinese art, and its novel and unique expressiveness is particularly suitable for expressing the traditional Chinese style of landscape, flower and bird patterns, which has a greater attraction and influence on the audience, suitable for visitors to watch, drink and experience, suitable for various receptions and large-scale celebrations, and can improve the added value of the tea industry and the grade of cultural tourism.
                  </li>
                <li>The Tea Parade is a new type of tea product that can be appreciated and tasted at the same time, and has a unique tasting value. It can be appreciated and tasted with matcha tea through the spotting method, or brewed and tasted with doughnut tea, making it an artistic treasure that transcends the times.</li>
                <li> Tea Bacchanal is a tea product with unique health benefits that can enrich the Chinese culture of health care. The tea is served with the tea soup and the tea powder, which provides the body with more insoluble nutrients such as gluten, vitamins, minerals, fibre, etc. than the modern tea brewing method and has its own irreplaceable health benefits. With its novel and unique artistic performance effect, the tea is suitable for various celebrations and exhibitions, which can better enhance the cultural taste and influence of the activities. Many news media such as CCTV, Taiwan's ETTV, China Sky TV, Southeast TV and Hong Kong Wen Wei Po interviewed and covered the event and displayed it at the Zhang Tianfu Foundation's New Year Tea Party and Tea Expo, which was well received. </li>
